The band met while studying engineering at Dalhousie University in 2019, originally playing the few venues available during the pandemic. After the release of their self produced EP "Low Balance" and single "Going Under", departure of their lead singer led to the current lineup: George Boyd, Liam Grundy, Kory Melchoir, and Drew Koerber, in the classic guitar-guitar-bass-drums formation.
                            Made up of three scotians, and one western transplant, the band makes a sound that is very honest, very raw, and very east coast. Lloyd's fears no boundaries when mixing rock genres such as indie, surf, punk, emo, blues, and psychedelia, as long as its fun, and as long as it feels right. Characterized by an energetic rhythm section and melodic guitar work, Lloyd's Money also delivers three part vocals. While sharing the mics, the boys also share the writing, and the unique influences of each member can be heard on the songs they lead. These influences include Canadian artists such as Peach Pit, Arcade Fire, and PUP, as well as those beyond the north such as the Arctic Monkeys, TURNSTILE, and Led Zeppelin.<br><br>
                            While some groups prefer to show their strength in their recordings, lloyd's money is a live band. Live on stage, with the crowd shaking the floor, is the best place to get the lloyd's experience.<BR><BR>
                            Lloyd's Money is currently rocking their debut, self-produced LP, "Lip Bomb", a ten track shotgun blast of honest songs written about being young, in love, and trying to figure it out in Halifax. The "Seattle of the East" label on our city has fallen out of use, and Lloyd's cannot stand for that.
